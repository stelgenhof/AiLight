**AiLight** is a custom firmware for the inexpensive Ai-Thinker (or equivalent) RGBW WiFi light bulbs that has an ESP8266 on board and is controlled by the MY9291 or MY9231 LED driver.

Current Stable Release: **v1.0.0** (Please read the [changelog](https://github.com/stelgenhof/AiLight/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for detailed information).

## Features

With **AiLight** you can:

- switch the light on or off
- set the level of the 4 colour channels (Red, Green, Blue and White)
- set the brightness level
- set the light at a particular [colour temperature](https://github.com/stelgenhof/AiLight/wiki/Colour-Temperature)
- let the light [flash](https://github.com/stelgenhof/AiLight/wiki/Flashing-the-Light) (i.e. blinking with a given colour and brightness)
- enable [Gamma Correction](https://github.com/stelgenhof/AiLight/wiki/Gamma-Correction) to make the LED colours appear closer to what our eyes perceive
- set the light to [transition](https://github.com/stelgenhof/AiLight/wiki/Transition) to the new state, rather than immediately.

This can all be done with the built-in (mobile friendly) Web UI or in [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io
) (using the MQTT built-in integration via JSON). The Web UI also gives you the ability to configure your Smart Light remotely. You can easily change your WiFi settings or the configuration of your MQTT broker.

### Other
- [REST API](https://github.com/stelgenhof/AiLight/wiki/REST-API)
- MQTT Last Will and Testament enabled
- Support for Home Assistant's [MQTT Discovery](https://github.com/stelgenhof/AiLight/wiki/Home-Assistant-MQTT-Discovery)
- Support for [Over The Air](https://github.com/stelgenhof/AiLight/wiki/OTA-Updates) (OTA) firmware updates
- Preserve light settings and configuration after power cycle or restart
- Perform remote [restart](https://github.com/stelgenhof/AiLight/wiki/Restart-%26-Reset) using the built-in HTML UI.
- [Reset](https://github.com/stelgenhof/AiLight/wiki/Restart-%26-Reset) to factory defaults using the built-in HTML UI (* 'factory' here means the default settings of the **AiLight** firmware upon compile time)


Making this firmware was largely inspired by the [MY9291](https://github.com/xoseperez/my9291) LED driver and the [Espurna](https://github.com/xoseperez/espurna) firmware of [Xose PÃ©rez](https://github.com/xoseperez).
